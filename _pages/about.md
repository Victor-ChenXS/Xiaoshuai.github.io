I am currently a second-year Ph.D. candidate at the Intelligent Robot Lab at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Dr. Petar Kormushev and co-supervision of Prof. Thrishantha Nanayakkara. My research focuses on explainable robot task understanding, particularly through symbolic methods. Before this, I was part of the REDS Lab at Imperial, supervised by Dr. Nicolas Rojas, now an Applied Scientist at The AI Institute, Boston Dynamics.

I hold an MRes degree in Medical Robotics and Image-Guided Intervention from the Hamlyn Centre, Imperial College London. My thesis, supervised by Dr. Benny Lo (now CEO of Precision Robotics) and Prof. Daniel Elson, explored intelligent healthcare system design. I was fortunate to receive funding from the Hamlyn Centre to support my studies in London.

My academic journey began at Chongqing University, where I spent the first two years of my undergraduate studies, famous for its hot-pot and rigorous academic environment. I was then awarded a scholarship through a 2+2 joint program to complete my studies at Queen's University Belfast, under the supervision of Prof. Yanjin and Dr. Danielle Soban. My final year project was focused on AIAA Aircraft Design.

During my bachelor's studies, I also completed a summer research internship at Tsinghua University, focusing on Intelligent Robotics, guided by Prof. Xinjun Liu.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or exploring potential collaborations.
