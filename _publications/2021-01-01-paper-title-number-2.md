In this paper, a robust activity (RA) and slow fall detection system is proposed. The system consists of a waist-worn wearable sensor embedded with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a barometer, and a reference ambient barometer. A deep neural network (DNN) is developed for fusing the sensor data and classifying fall events. The results have shown that the IMU-barometer design yield better detection of fall events and the DNN approach (90.33% accuracy) outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms.
